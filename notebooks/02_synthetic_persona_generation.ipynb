      "Sean Greaves is currently employed as an Applied AI Engineer at The Autonomy Institute, a think tank focused on data-driven tools for sustainable economic planning. He has spent the past five years in the technology and AI research industry, building a career that includes a variety of roles in machine learning and software development. Greaves holds a Master's degree in Design Informatics and has secured a range of positions, including researcher, machine learning solutions engineer at Seldon and IBM, and an intern at IXDS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout his career, Greaves has co-developed technical strategies, secured funding for projects, and authored publications that have been cited by governmental bodies and various media outlets. His key skills include applied AI, machine learning, software development, data analysis, technical writing, mentorship, and public speaking. He has also led initiatives to mentor early-career professionals and has contributed to multiple high-profile projects focused on economic equity and technology's intersection with society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greaves' intellectual interests encompass political theory, AI and society, economic planning, technology ethics, and neoliberalism. He consumes various media, including classics, political economy, sociology, non-fiction, and current affairs. He regularly reads publications such as The London Review of Books and The Financial Times, and listens to podcasts including Doomscroll and the Red Scare Podcast. His media diet includes materials that span different political viewpoints, as evidenced by his subscriptions to both left-leaning and centrist sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of his political leanings, Greaves appears to align with leftist ideologies, advocating for values such as transparency, democracy, sustainability, and social justice. He is particularly concerned with causes like climate change, economic equity, digital rights, and labor rights. Based on his media consumption and reading choices, it can be inferred that he likely engages with complex societal and economic issues critically and is probably supportive of policies aligned with social justice and sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greaves' work style is characterized as collaborative, and he communicates in an analytical manner, suggesting a preference for team-oriented projects and data-driven discussions. His career trajectory indicates a pattern of integrating technical skills with socio-economic advocacy, focusing on leveraging technology for societal benefits and ethical considerations in AI deployment. His moderate risk tolerance suggests a careful approach toward innovation and project development.\n"

      "Dale Hutchins is a long-haul truck driver based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with over 30 years of experience in the transportation industry. He holds a valid Class A Commercial Driver's License (CDL) and possesses a strong understanding of Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations and safety compliance. Hutchins has an extensive work history that includes his current role at ABC Freight Lines, where he has been employed since March 2015, consistently delivering freight across the continental United States while maintaining a clean driving record with zero accidents or violations. His previous positions include working at XYZ Logistics and Local Transport Services, where he also focused on safe deliveries and efficient route management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hutchins graduated from Tulsa High School in 1983 with a high school diploma. In terms of intellectual interests, he engages with a range of topics including true crime, cooking, sports, personal development, literature, and barbecue. His media consumption includes various podcasts such as \"Sword and Scale,\" \"Criminal,\" \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" and \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" along with YouTube channels dedicated to model trains and cooking, such as \"View from the Top\" and \"Cooks Country.\" He also watches streaming series, notably \"Mindhunter,\" and follows conservative news sources like \"The Daily Signal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hutchins’ reading habits reflect diverse interests, with recent reads including novels, self-help, and cookbook literature, such as \"The Night Circus,\" \"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,\" and \"The Ultimate Barbecue Sauces and Marinades.\" His interests suggest an inclination towards storytelling in both fiction and real-life narratives, as seen in his engagement with true crime media.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of his consumption of conservative news and true crime content suggests a probable alignment with right-leaning political views, while his interests in personal development and cooking indicate a focus on self-improvement and practical skills. Moreover, Hutchins demonstrates an independent work style, emphasizing safety and reliability in his professional life, which may reflect his broader worldview centered on stability and quality. His communication style is direct, and he appears to have a risk-averse attitude, favoring compliance and safety in both his career and personal pursuits. The observable patterns in Hutchins' career point to a commitment to quality and customer service, as well as an extensive practical knowledge of the logistics and transportation industry.\n"

    "This highlights the value in having personas based on real people as they are likely much more representative and useful. LLMs are much better at inferering persona attributes from existing data than generating them. This upsells any organisation that has an existing database of personas. It would also be important as this notebook shows to be able to go in and audit the represented opinions of those personas to see if they're realistic. Essentially they are performing and we should approach them like a **film/theatre critic** would a performer."
