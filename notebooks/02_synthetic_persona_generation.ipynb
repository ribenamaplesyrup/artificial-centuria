    "This highlights the value in having personas based on real people as they are likely much more representative and useful. LLMs are much better at inferering persona attributes from existing data than generating them. This upsells any organisation that has an existing database of personas. It would also be important as this notebook shows to be able to go in and audit the represented opinions of those personas to see if they're realistic. Essentially they are performing and we should approach them like a **film/theatre critic** would a performer."
