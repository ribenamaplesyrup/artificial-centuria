<h1>Weekend adventures in artificial societies...</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Notes from building simulations of human collectives</p>

<p>
	This is a collection of small experiments exploring what happens when you give
	language models personalities and put them in rooms together. Some of these
	work. Most of them fail in interesting ways.

<p>
	The underlying library is called <em>Centuria</em> — named for the Roman
	military unit of roughly 100 soldiers. The goal is to eventually simulate
	groups of that size, each with distinct backgrounds, beliefs, and behaviors.
