<h1>Weekend adventures in artificial societies...</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Notes from building simulations of human collectives</p>

<p>
	This is a small collection of experiments into silicon sampling — asking
	language models to simulate human populations and seeing what happens. Some
	of these work. Most of them fail in interesting ways.
</p>

<p>
	Each failure highlights the limits of where vibecoding can take you, arriving
	at moats that suggest the need for real experience and better tools.
