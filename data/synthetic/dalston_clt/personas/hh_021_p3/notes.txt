- Need to finish the trauma rotation report by Friday, focus on the key cases I saw.  
- Reminder: Call Mom on the way home to check in.  
- Just finished that documentary on healthcare in low-income countries—really eye-opening! Need to look into the initiatives they discussed.  
- Feeling a bit burnt out after the night shift, maybe I should start doing some evening yoga or meditation.  
- Pick up milk and bread after work. Don’t forget Auntie Lale’s birthday gift—maybe a nice plant from the market?
