- Must remember to bring extra yarn to the knit-and-natter group this week; the girls are starting a new blanket!  
- Call Dr. Patel to schedule my eye exam. Need new glasses before summer.  
- That new historical drama on BBC looks interesting; check it out when I have a moment.  
- Sat in the garden today—so peaceful. Need to do that more often; it really lifts my spirits.  
- Pick up milk and bread from the corner shop after my library visit tomorrow. Also, get a card for Sarah's birthday!
