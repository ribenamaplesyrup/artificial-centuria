**Health/Wellness Goals for Emily Thompson**

- **Diet Goals:**  
  - Aim for at least 5 servings of fruits and veggies daily. Think about trying a new seasonal veggie each week from the local market!  
  - Limit processed foods and sugars, especially those tempting biscuits during *knit-and-natter*. Instead, maybe bring some homemade or healthier snacks to share with the group.  
  - Stay hydrated—try to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day. Keep a cute water bottle nearby as a reminder.  

- **Exercise Intentions:**  
  - Try to walk for at least 30 minutes every day, whether it’s around the neighborhood or in the park near the library. Enjoy the fresh air!  
  - Consider gentle stretching or tai chi videos online a few times a week to improve flexibility and balance.  
  - Keep attending knitting groups and social gatherings—they’re great for staying active and connected!

- **Health Concerns:**  
  - Keep an eye on bone health; consider weight-bearing exercises to strengthen bones.  
  - Monitor blood pressure and cholesterol levels; schedule regular checks if necessary.  
  - Stay aware of joint health, especially fingers and knees—do some gentle mobility exercises if there’s stiffness.  

- **Medications/Supplements:**  
  - Review current medications with her doctor during appointments (like those for blood pressure or cholesterol).  
  - Look into calcium and vitamin D if not already taking them—great for bone health.  
  - Consider a multivitamin tailored for seniors to ensure nutritional needs are met.  

- **Doctor Appointment Notes:**  
  - Next check-up coming up in two months—make a list of any health concerns or symptoms to discuss.  
  - Remember to ask about vision and hearing—important at this age!  
  - If feeling down or anxious, mention this to the doctor; emotional health is just as important.  

- **Other Thoughts:**  
  - Make time for easy mental exercises, like puzzles or reading new books from the library—it helps keep the mind sharp!  
  - Plan some relaxing time in the garden a few times a week; it’s peaceful and promotes well-being.
