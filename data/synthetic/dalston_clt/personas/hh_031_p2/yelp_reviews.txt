**Wok & Roll Sushi Bar  
Restaurant  
Rating: ★★★★☆**

Wok & Roll is a gem! As someone who's into sushi but also on a student budget, this place hits the sweet spot. The sushi rolls are fresh and won’t break the bank. I tried their Spicy Tuna Roll and it was spot on! The staff is cool, and they seem to really care about their customers, which makes the sushi taste even better. Only downside? It’s a bit small and can get crowded at peak times. But, totally worth the wait. If you’re in Dalston and craving sushi, this is the place to be.

**Byte Hackers Repair  
Tech Repair Service  
Rating: ★★★★☆**

I've had my fair share of tech disasters – totally part and parcel of being a coding geek, I guess! When my laptop decided to have a meltdown two days before a coding competition, Byte Hackers saved me. These guys seriously know their stuff. Fast turnaround and didn't charge me the earth. Only problem was finding the place, as it's tucked away, but maybe that’s part of its charm. If you're in need of a tech rescue, definitely drop by.

**The Rusty Wrench  
Mechanic  
Rating: ★★★★☆**

Not every teenager has their own set of wheels, but my mum does, and I’ve seen enough breakdowns to need a good mechanic. The Rusty Wrench doesn’t just have a cool name, these guys are the real deal. Mum’s car had an issue with the brakes, and they sorted it quickly and at a decent price. They explain the issues in a way both me and my mum can get, which is rare. I’ll happily make this place my go-to whenever I finally get my own car!

**The Dalston Cut  
Hair Salon  
Rating: ★★★★☆**

Finding a decent haircut isn't always easy when you're juggling homework and gaming, but The Dalston Cut is a lifesaver. The barbers there get what young people want, and they really pay attention. I went for a trim and came out with a style that looks cool, and it was done fast, which is perfect when you have coding competitions on the horizon. The salon has a great vibe, too. Highly recommend if you're in need of a fresh look.

**La Piadineria  
Italian Eatery  
Rating: ★★★★★**

I recently visited La Piadineria when I was out with some mates, and wow, it was a taste revelation. I'd never tried a piadina before, but it was amazing! Think of it as an Italian wrap filled with absolute brilliance. I had the caprese, which was fresh and just the right amount of filling. We all left seriously satisfied. Prices are student-friendly, and the staff were super-nice. Totally at the top of my list for quick, tasty bites.

**Geek Retreat London  
Gaming Café and Store  
Rating: ★★★★★**

This place is heaven for anyone into games and geek culture. I'm there almost every weekend to join game nights or just chill. The atmosphere is laid-back, people there are super friendly, and the milkshakes are delicious. It's also a fantastic spot if you're into board games or want to try something new. If you’re a game enthusiast like me, give it a go. You'll find me here gleefully smashing buttons on a controller most Saturday afternoons!
