**Review:** I love this essential oil set! The scents are delightful and really help to freshen up my home after long days of cleaning. I use them in a diffuser while I tidy up, and they create such a lovely atmosphere. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I wish there were more options in the set. Otherwise, a lovely purchase!

**Review:** I decided to get a Netflix subscription to have some entertainment for those quiet evenings at home. There’s so much to watch — I’ve been binge-watching documentaries and cooking shows!

**Product:** Tupperware 16-Piece Set  
**Platform:** Amazon  
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** I bought this Tupperware set to organize my groceries better, and while it does the job, I find some of the lids don’t fit as snug as I’d hope. The variety in sizes is nice, though, and they are very easy to clean. Just wish they were a bit sturdier. Not a bad purchase for the price, but I’ll keep looking for better quality.
