- Need to start revising for history exam. Last minute cramming won’t cut it this time!
  
- Reminder: pick up milk and bread after school. Don’t forget the snacks for the weekend.

- Just watched that new series Sarah mentioned—she was right, it’s actually pretty good! Need to tell her I binge-watched the whole season.

- Feeling kind of overwhelmed with schoolwork. Maybe I should set a real study schedule instead of winging it...

- Dentist appointment on Tuesday at 3pm. Ugh, hope it’s just a check-up and nothing else!
