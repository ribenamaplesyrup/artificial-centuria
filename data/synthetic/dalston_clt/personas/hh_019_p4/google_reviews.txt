**Elderbloom Corner Shop**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
The best little corner shop in Dalston! I grab my lunch here almost every day. The sandwiches are super fresh, and they have a great selection of snacks. Plus, the staff are really friendly and always say hi. I can’t imagine my school lunch without stopping here!

**La Bella Italia**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Came here with some friends for pizza last weekend, and it didn’t disappoint! The margherita was delicious, and I loved how they use fresh basil. The atmosphere is nice and cozy, which makes it a great spot to hang out after school. We’ll definitely be back!

**Dalston Park**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
This park is such a chill place to spend a sunny afternoon. There are plenty of benches to chill with mates, and the green space is perfect for kicking a ball around. I also like walking my dog here when I have the time. It's a local gem!

**Starbucks - Dalston**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Great spot for studying and grabbing a coffee. The Wi-Fi is reliable, so I can sit there for hours while cramming for exams. I usually get a caramel latte, which is super tasty! Just wish it wasn't so busy during exam season.

**The Spice Garden**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Honestly, this is my favourite takeaway! Their chicken tikka masala is the best I’ve ever had. Perfect blend of spices, and the naan bread is always warm and fluffy. It’s become my go-to for a Friday night treat after a long week at school.

**Game Central**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Decent local gaming shop with a good selection of games and consoles. They hold tournaments, which are fun to join, but the staff can be a bit snarky sometimes. Still, I love browsing for new releases when I get some pocket money.

**Dalston Theatre**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Went to watch a film here last week, and I really enjoyed it! The seats are comfortable, and the ticket prices are super reasonable. It's not the fanciest place, but it's nice to have a local cinema that shows indie films as well as the big blockbusters.

**The Book Nook**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
This tiny bookstore is an absolute treasure! The staff is super helpful and always recommend the best reads. I found a few hidden gems while browsing, and they have a lovely cozy reading area. Perfect for when I need to unwind after studying!
