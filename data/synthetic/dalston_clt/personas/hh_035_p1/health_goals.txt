### Martin Turner’s Health & Wellness Notes

**Diet Goals:**
- Aim for more balanced meals: focus on whole grains, lean proteins, and plenty of veggies.
- Limit processed snacks during the week—try to keep them to weekends only.
- Experiment with meal prepping on Sundays to stay organized for the week.
- Keep a food diary for one week to track what I eat and how it affects my energy levels.

**Exercise Intentions:**
- Start with 20-30 minutes of walking at least 3 days a week—perfect after school or during lunch breaks.
- Try a new sport or activity—maybe a local community football or running club to mix things up?
- Set a goal to take the stairs instead of the lift at school—small but effective!
- Include some strength training: consider a couple of sessions per week with bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats).

**Health Concerns:**
- Monitor blood pressure considering family history; a check-up every 1-2 years recommended.
- Stay on top of mental health—consider mindfulness or meditation to help with stress from work.
- Keep an eye on weight; trying to find a comfortable range that works with my current lifestyle.
- Be aware of signs of fatigue- aim to improve sleep quality by reducing screen time before bed.

**Medications/Supplements:**
- Consider a multivitamin to support overall health, especially during exam seasons!
- Talk to the doctor about Omega-3 supplements—read that they can be beneficial for brain health.

**Doctor Appointment Notes:**
- Schedule an annual physical check-up; discuss any concerns about fatigue.
- Mention if I’ve noticed any changes in my cholesterol since last check-up.
- Bring up the idea of a dietary consult if I'm struggling with meal planning.
- Ask about flu shots in the fall—staying healthy at school is key! 

Let’s keep it realistic but also push for some small changes that stick!
