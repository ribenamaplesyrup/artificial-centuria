**Business Name:** The Curated Brew  
**Type:** Coffee Shop  
**Rating:** ★★★★☆  
**Review:** Stumbled upon The Curated Brew last weekend, and what a find! The atmosphere is chill, the kind of place where you order a flat white and end up staying for hours. The staff is friendly, always up for a chat, and they know their stuff when it comes to beans. Plus, they hosted an open mic night - a perfect spot if music's your thing. A little pricey, but considering the quality, totally worth it!

**Business Name:** Old Spitalfields Chop House  
**Type:** Restaurant  
**Rating:** ★★★★★  
**Review:** Absolutely fantastic. As a guy who loves both football and music, dining here before or after a match at the pub is ideal. Their steak and ale pie is hands down the best in London. The ambiance is just right - bustling but not chaotic. And they even play indie tracks that resonate with us East Londoners. Pints are well priced too, a bonus for when you’re with the mates. Five stars without a doubt!

**Business Name:** Dalston Hair Haven  
**Type:** Hair Salon  
**Rating:** ★★★★★  
**Review:** Not just a haircut, but an experience! The team at Dalston Hair Haven is brilliant. They listen to what you want and deliver better than expected. The salon has this local vibe, where it feels like catching up with mates instead of an appointment. If you’re looking for a fresh cut that won't break the bank, this is your spot.

**Business Name:** Quick Fix Auto Centre  
**Type:** Mechanic  
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** Needed a quick MOT and took my old car down to Quick Fix. Service was okay - nothing to write home about. They got the job done but didn't really blow me away with the service. Prices are fair, but I've had friendlier experiences in other places. Might go back in a pinch, but still on the lookout for my go-to garage.

**Business Name:** Bistro de Lyon (Paris Trip)  
**Type:** Restaurant  
**Rating:** ★★★★★  
**Review:** Went to Paris for the weekend with my mates and had dinner at Bistro de Lyon. A true gem! Rustic and cozy, the kind of place where you can indulge in French classics. The boeuf bourguignon was unreal, paired with a decent selection of wines. The staff's English wasn't perfect, but their warmth made up for it. Worth the little splash if you ever cross the channel.

**Type:** Plant Nursery  
**Rating:** ★★★★★  
**Review:** Got a couple of new plants for the flat from Green Street Gardens, and I'm thrilled. They have a fantastic variety, and the staff really knows their stuff. Being a novice with plants, I appreciated the tips they offered. If you're looking to brighten up your space without going full Monty Don, check them out!
