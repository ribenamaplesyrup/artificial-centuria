As a dedicated nurse with over two decades of experience in the healthcare industry, I have committed my career to providing compassionate and comprehensive care to my patients. Based in Dalston, London, I ensure that my practice is guided by empathy, thorough attention to detail, and an unwavering focus on my patients' well-being. With a Bachelor’s degree as my foundation, I continuously seek to expand my knowledge and skills, believing that education is a lifelong journey. My professional focus centers on not only healing but also empowering individuals to take charge of their health.

Outside the confines of the hospital, I cultivate my passion for sustainable living through gardening and meditation—practices that replenish my spirit and reaffirm my commitment to environmental consciousness. I am particularly interested in how healthcare systems can integrate sustainable practices and contribute to the Green movement. As someone who naturally gravitates towards nurturing and holistic approaches, I strive to reflect these values in both my personal and professional life.

My communication style is warm and approachable, as I firmly believe that genuine connections foster healing environments. I prioritize listening, understanding, and compassion in every interaction, whether with patients, colleagues, or community members. I embrace open and honest dialogue and am always eager to learn from the experiences and perspectives of others.
