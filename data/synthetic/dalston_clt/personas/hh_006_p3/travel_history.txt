Isaac Oseni, a 19-year-old university student from Dalston, London, has had a modest travel history over the past few years, reflecting his focus on education and budget-conscious lifestyle.

In the summer before starting university, Isaac took a budget-friendly trip with friends to Barcelona, Spain. They stayed in a youth hostel and explored the city's vibrant culture, architecture, and beaches. Isaac booked the trip using a popular travel app, taking advantage of student discounts and affordable travel deals.

A few months later, Isaac visited Amsterdam for a weekend with his family. This trip was slightly more relaxed, with accommodations in a comfortable but affordable Airbnb. The family enjoyed cycling around the city and visiting tech-related exhibitions, given Isaac's interest in technology.

Most recently, Isaac embarked on a short solo trip to Dublin, Ireland, during a university break. Seeking adventure on a budget, he explored the city's history and culture, favoring free or low-cost attractions. He again utilized a travel app to book low-cost airline tickets and a spot in a budget-friendly hostel.

Isaac's travel style leans towards budget-conscious adventures, prioritizing meaningful experiences over luxury. He typically plans his trips using travel apps and seizes student deals whenever possible. His bucket list includes tech hubs and vibrant cities like Tokyo, Japan; Berlin, Germany; and San Francisco, USA. These destinations reflect his passion for technology and diverse cultures.
