**Business Name:** Mac's Auto Repair  
**Type:** Mechanic  
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** Mac’s is okay, but I felt a bit mixed about my experience. They fixed the brakes on my car, which was great, but the service felt a bit rushed. They didn’t explain everything clearly, and I left feeling like I had a few questions. Still, my car is running smoothly now, so I might go back if I need more work done.
