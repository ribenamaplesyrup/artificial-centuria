- Look into that show Sarah mentioned, sounds interesting. Maybe it’ll keep me entertained while I’m resting.  
- Grocery list: milk, eggs, a couple of tomatoes. Don’t forget the bread!  
- Don’t forget to call Mom this weekend, it’s been a while since we chatted.  
- Watched a piece on Turkey’s economy today, quite concerning. I hope things start turning around.  
- Remind myself to drop by the café and pick up that baklava for Aylin’s birthday on Friday.
