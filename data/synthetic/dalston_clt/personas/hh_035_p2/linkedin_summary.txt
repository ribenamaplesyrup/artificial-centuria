As a passionate and innovative graphic designer based in the vibrant neighborhood of Dalston, London, I bring a unique blend of creativity and sustainability to every project I undertake. With a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, I specialize in crafting visually compelling and eco-friendly solutions for brands looking to make a meaningful impact. Committed to pushing the envelope, my goal is to merge art and environmental consciousness, producing designs that not only stand out but also leave a positive footprint.

Outside of my professional life, I am deeply engaged with the local art community. You'll often find me engrossed in the latest exhibits at Dalston's eclectic galleries or catching an indie film screening. My passion for creativity extends beyond the digital canvas to my balcony garden, where I experiment with sustainable urban gardening practices. As a Green Party supporter, I am continually inspired by nature and strive to infuse that inspiration into both my lifestyle and my work.

I value genuine and open communication, believing that transparency and collaboration are keys to achieving the best creative outcomes. Whether brainstorming with clients or sharing insights with colleagues, I aim to foster an environment where innovative ideas can flourish.
