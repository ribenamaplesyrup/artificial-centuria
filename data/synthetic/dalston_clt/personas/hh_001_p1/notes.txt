- Remember to clean up the bar after the Saturday night rush. Can’t keep leaving it for Monday crew.  
- Call mom this weekend, haven’t chatted in a while.  
- Look into that show Sarah mentioned, might help me unwind after shifts.  
- Really need to pick up some groceries tomorrow. Milk, bread, and maybe that frozen lasagna.  
- Dentist on Tuesday at 3 PM. Don’t want to forget and get stuck with a late fee.
