- Finish my science project about dinosaurs. I need to print out the pictures of T-Rex and Triceratops!

- Goal for next week: practice swimming so I can finally dive without holding my nose.

- Watched that new show Sarah told me about. The talking animals are super funny! I want to tell her I loved it.

- Sometimes I wish I could trade my rare Pikachu for that shiny Gyarados... but I really love Pikachu. 

- Don’t forget to pick up milk after school, and maybe add some chocolate biscuits for the weekend.
