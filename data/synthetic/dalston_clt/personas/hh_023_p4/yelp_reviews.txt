**Business Name:** Dalston Pizza Co.  
**Type:** Restaurant  
**Rating:** ★★★★☆  
**Review:** “So, I hit up Dalston Pizza Co. with my mates last Friday night, and wow, the pizza here is fire! 🍕 I got the BBQ chicken and it was so tasty, with that perfect crunchy base. Prices are super chill for a student too. Only complaint? The place gets kinda packed, but we ended up chilling outside, so all good in the end. Definitely recommend if you need a late-night slice!”

**Business Name:** Cloud Nine Hair Salon  
**Type:** Hair Salon  
**Rating:** ★★★★☆  
**Review:** “Just got my haircut at Cloud Nine and I’m pretty pleased! The stylist actually listened to what I wanted and didn’t just chop away. The vibe is relaxed, and I didn’t feel rushed at all. It’s a bit on the pricier side for me, but hey, you pay for good hair! I’ll be back for sure.”

**Business Name:** Ace Mechanics  
**Type:** Auto Repair  
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** “Took my dad’s old car here because it was making weird noises. Ace Mechanics fixed the engine issue but it took way longer than I expected. They were honest about costs, which I appreciated, but the wait time was a bummer. Slightly above average experience; I might try another place next time.”

**Type:** Café  
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** “The Corner Café is your classic chill spot for a snack and coffee. I grabbed a hot chocolate there one afternoon while studying, and it was fine, nothing too special. Prices are okay, but I wasn't blown away by the pastries. It’s a nice place to hang out and do some revision, though!”
