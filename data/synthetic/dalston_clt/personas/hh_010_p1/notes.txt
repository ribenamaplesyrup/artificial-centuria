- Don’t forget to pick up milk and bread after work tomorrow.  
- Goal this week: try to streamline my morning coffee prep so I can enjoy a few extra minutes of peace before heading into the café.  
- Just watched that doc about coffee farms - really makes me appreciate the work that goes into each cup.  
- Feeling grateful for family time on Sunday. It’s nice to catch up and unwind a bit.  
- Need to call Mom and check in, and maybe look into that show Sarah mentioned. Sounds interesting!
