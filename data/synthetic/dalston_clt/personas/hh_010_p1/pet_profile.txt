Aylin Demir does not currently have any pets. Living in Dalston, London, in a bustling area and working as a barista with early morning and sometimes irregular hours, her lifestyle does not easily accommodate the responsibility of pet ownership at this time. Her rented housing at 19 Hackett Green Road also has specific landlord regulations that restrict pet ownership. Despite not having pets, Aylin's love for animals is evident as she often volunteers at a local community center, where she spends time with therapy dogs that visit the elderly, providing her with a way to connect with animals without the long-term commitment.
