**Profile Name:** Hasan, 23

**Location:** Dalston, London

**Bio:**  
🚴‍♂️ Bike courier by day, food lover by night. Always on the move and munching on delicious bites between deliveries. I take pride in knowing the fastest routes (both for my job and in life). 🎯 Looking for someone who enjoys spontaneous adventures and isn't afraid of a little chaos. Bonus points if you can share your favorite street food spots!

**What they're looking for:**  
Someone who feels at home in the hustle and bustle of city life, loves food as much as I do, and is ready to explore new neighborhoods together. If you have an adventurous spirit and enjoy good conversations, let's connect!

**Deal-breakers:**  
- Disinterest in trying new foods or exploring the city.
- Unwillingness to embrace a fast-paced lifestyle.
- Being overly critical of spontaneous plans.

**Prompts/answers:**  
- **"My ideal weekend includes..."**  
Riding through the city parks, checking out new food trucks, and binge-watching a series together after a long day of cycling around.

- **"I'm overly competitive about..."**  
Finding the best local pizza joint and trying to beat my own record for fastest delivery time. 

- **"One thing I can't live without..."**  
My bike! It’s my trusty steed and my ultimate freedom machine—always ready for another adventure!
