Margaret Griffiths' Pet Profile:

Although Margaret Griffiths enjoys the company of animals and often stops to admire her neighbors' pets during her daily walks around Dalston, she currently does not have any pets of her own. The primary reason for this is her living situation; the residence at 1 Baker's Lane Mews does not allow pets, as stipulated by the landlord's regulations. In addition, Margaret's part-time work schedule and her active involvement in the local craft club mean that she might not have the necessary time to properly care for a pet. Instead, Margaret channels her nurturing instincts through her hobbies, such as baking and knitting, and by socializing with friends and neighbors in her community.
