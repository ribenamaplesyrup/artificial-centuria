1. Must remember to pick up more sunflower seeds for the garden - they bring the most beautiful birds to the yard.

2. Finished that book on the Ottoman Empire; fascinating how much history shapes our little London nook.

3. Josh’s birthday is next week – maybe a new gardening tool set could be a thoughtful gift.

4. Community potluck this Saturday - I should bring the potato salad like last time.

5. Check with Maggie about the history documentary she mentioned – the one about ancient trade routes.
