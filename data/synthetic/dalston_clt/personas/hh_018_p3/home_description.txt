Leyla Kazım resides in a modest flatshare on Weaver's End Street in Dalston, London, perfectly situated for a vibrant student life. Renting a small but cozy room, she shares the flat with two other university students, creating a lively and dynamic home environment. Her room is a reflection of her creative spirit, with walls adorned with her own photography capturing the essence of East London's vibrant streets. The decor is eclectic, a blend of bohemian and contemporary styles, featuring mismatched cushions and colorful throws on a second-hand armchair she snagged from a local charity shop. An assortment of indoor plants lines the windowsill, thriving in the dappled sunlight that filters through light curtains. Her space, while cluttered with camera equipment and books on media theory, feels lived-in yet inviting. Despite the occasional messiness typical for a busy student, Leyla keeps her living space organized enough to maintain a cozy and inspiring atmosphere for her studies and creative endeavors.
