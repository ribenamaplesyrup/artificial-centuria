A lovely spot to gather with friends for a pint. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the bar staff really know how to pull a good pint. I always enjoy their fish and chips on pub quiz night—proper comfort food! Just wish they had a bigger range of beers.

What a gem of a park! I take my morning walks here regularly, and it’s a great place to clear my head. Well-maintained paths, beautiful flower beds, and plenty of benches to sit and enjoy the birds. It's nice to see the community using the space for picnics and events. A real treasure in the city!
