- Need to start reading that mystery novel I borrowed last week. It’s been sitting on the table too long.  
- Pick up some milk and bread on Wednesday after the library.  
- Really enjoyed that documentary about the history of transport—funny how my past job ties into it!  
- Remember to feed the pigeons at Hackney Downs again tomorrow; they seem to be waiting for me.  
- Dentist appointment Tuesday at 3pm. Don’t forget to ask about that tooth.
