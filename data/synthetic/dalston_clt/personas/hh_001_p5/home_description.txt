Emine Aydin lives with her family in a modest, two-bedroom flat on Hackett Green Road in Dalston, London. The flat is rented, reflecting their urban and budget-conscious lifestyle in this vibrant district. The interior space is cozy and filled with natural light, allowing Emine to indulge in her passion for painting comfortably in her room, which doubles as a small, personal art studio. The decor across the flat blends practicality with a touch of Emine's artistic flair, featuring her own artwork along the walls and pops of color through handmade crafts. The living area is comfortable and slightly cluttered with artistic materials, a testament to Emine's creative pursuits. While the flat maintains a lived-in, familial warmth, it's generally tidy, thanks to Emine's efforts in helping with household chores. A small balcony offers a glimpse of the bustling street below, serving as Emine's occasional retreat to gather inspiration and solace.
