Veronika Ivanova lives in a modest, two-bedroom flat with her family on Weaver's End Street in Dalston, London. The flat is rented, reflective of the typical living arrangements for families in this bustling, urban area. Veronika shares the space with her parents and a younger brother. The interior of their flat is cozy and filled with a mix of functional furniture and personal touches that hint at Veronika's artistic flair; her framed sketches and handmade crafts pepper the walls of her room and the common areas. The decor leans towards an eclectic bohemian style, with vibrant colors and textures adding warmth to the minimalist furnishings. A small upright piano occupies a corner of the living room, serving both as a focal point and a testament to Veronika's musical pursuits. Despite the frequent bustle of family life, Veronika makes a conscious effort to keep her personal space tidy and organized, although her creativity often spills over into delightful chaos of art supplies and sheet music scattered about her room.
