- **Driving Habits**: Although he does not own a vehicle, Marcus holds a valid driver's license and occasionally rents a car or uses cab services for weekend trips outside the city. These are often tied to countryside excursions or trips that require carrying musical instruments, such as attending orchestras or music festivals where public transport might not be as convenient.
