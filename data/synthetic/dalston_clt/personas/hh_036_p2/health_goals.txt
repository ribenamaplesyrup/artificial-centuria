- **Diet Goals**: Focus on incorporating more whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins to keep energy up for teaching and violin practice. Try to minimize processed snacks during busy school days.

- **Exercise Intentions**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity 4-5 times a week, perhaps a mix of brisk walking or cycling around Dalston. Consider adding yoga or pilates to improve flexibility and reduce stress.

- **Health Concerns for Age**: Keep an eye on cardiovascular health; consider getting cholesterol and blood pressure checked during regular doctor visits. Think about incorporating heart-healthy foods and activities.

- **Medications/Supplements**: Think about a daily multivitamin to cover any nutritional gaps. Consider omega-3 supplements for overall health, particularly if fish intake is low.

- **Doctor Appointment Notes**: Schedule annual physical exams to stay on top of overall health. Mention any recurring aches or stress-related issues, especially from spending long hours standing or sitting while teaching. Consider asking for advice on maintaining good posture while playing the violin.
