- Need to finalize lesson plan for next week’s history lesson on WWI. Check for any new resources online.  
- Reminder: Call Mom on Sunday to catch up.  
- Just finished a documentary on the Roman Empire. Inspiring! Need to incorporate some of the visuals into my lessons.  
- Feeling burnt out after the week; maybe I should take a day off soon to recharge.  
- Grocery list: milk, eggs, bread, and some snacks for quiz night. Don't forget to get card for Sarah's birthday.
