Sofia Giannopoulos, a 24-year-old waitress living in London, primarily supports causes related to environmental conservation and music education for underprivileged children. She makes modest donations, typically contributing around £10 to £20 every few months, often prompted by specific campaigns through crowdfunding platforms or social media initiatives.

Sofia's lifestyle and financial situation mean she donates infrequently, with her last recorded donation being £15 to an environmental charity running a campaign to plant more trees in urban areas. Additionally, Sofia has participated in volunteer activities twice in the past year, once helping to organize a local community event focused on recycling education and another time assisting at a music workshop for kids.

Sofia is also engaged in fundraising efforts, having joined a charity fun run earlier this year. She raised £150 through her social network to support a cause dedicated to improving access to music classes in public schools. While she doesn't have the means to donate large sums, Sofia stays involved by leveraging her interests and social circle to support the issues she cares about.
