**Profile:**

**Name:** Katherine  
**Age:** 29  
**Location:** Flat 3 Ironmonger Pass Estate, Dalston, London  
**Occupation:** Registered Nurse  
**Education:** Bachelor's degree  
**Political Lean:** Labour  

**Bio:**  
💉 Shift worker by day (and night), caffeine-dependent life-saver by choice! I love serving my community as a nurse at a local hospital. On my days off, you can find me visiting my aunt in Peckham for some quality family time or scrolling through Uber Eats menus (seriously, leave the cooking to the pros!). Looking for someone who can appreciate a late-night snack run and isn't afraid of a little unpredictability. Let’s see who can find the best late-night takeaway!

**What I’m Looking For:**  
Someone who is kind, down-to-earth, and appreciates the little things in life! I’m drawn to good conversations, spontaneous adventures, and a partner who loves food as much as I do. Humor is a plus!

**Deal-breakers:**  
- Poor communication skills  
- Lack of ambition or drive  
- Anyone who doesn’t respect my profession or the hours I work  

**Prompts/Answers:**  
- **Most spontaneous thing I’ve done:** Booked a last-minute trip to Cornwall just to escape for the weekend. It was a much-needed breath of fresh air!  
- **I’m overly competitive about:** Board games! Be prepared to lose (or at least face some playful trash-talk).  
- **Two truths and a lie:** I once saved a life in a cafe, I hate sushi, and I have a cat named Espresso. (Guess the lie!)  

Katherine is earnest but also lighthearted, looking for a meaningful connection that can withstand her irregular schedule.
