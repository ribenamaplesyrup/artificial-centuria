As a dedicated Registered Nurse based in Dalston, London, I have a strong commitment to providing compassionate care to my patients. With a Bachelor's degree in nursing, I've spent the past several years honing my skills in a fast-paced hospital environment, where I thrive during late shifts and enjoy the rewarding challenges that each new day brings. My focus is on patient-centered care, always striving to ensure comfort and understanding for those in need. 

When I'm not at the hospital, you can find me grabbing Uber Eats on busy nights or visiting my aunt in Peckham every other Sunday. These moments help me recharge and maintain a healthy work-life balance. I’m passionate about healthcare advocacy, particularly regarding mental health awareness and accessibility, and I actively engage with my community to promote these causes. I'm always looking to connect with like-minded professionals who are equally passionate about making a positive impact in the healthcare industry.
