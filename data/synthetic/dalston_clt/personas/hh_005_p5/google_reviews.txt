**Place Name: The Green Leaf Bistro**  
**Rating: ★★★★★**  
**Review: I absolutely adore this little gem in Dalston. The Green Leaf Bistro offers a delightful array of healthy and flavourful dishes that suit my preference for lighter meals. The spinach and ricotta ravioli is divine, and the lemon drizzle cake is to die for! Their white tea is a perfect accompaniment. Whether for lunch with a friend or a solo treat, I always feel welcomed and pampered.**  

**Place Name: Hackett Green Pharmacy**  
**Rating: ★★★★☆**  
**Review: A reliable pharmacy with friendly staff who are always willing to help. I appreciate their fast service and how they remember frequent customers. They have a decent selection of over-the-counter items as well. My only wish is for slightly more competitive pricing on prescription medications.**  

**Place Name: Dalston Public Library**  
**Rating: ★★★★★**

**Place Name: The Blooming Pot**  
**Rating: ★★★★☆**  
**Review: I loved purchasing my summer plants here. The selection is wonderful, and the staff are knowledgeable about what grows best in our local soil. My garden has never looked better! The only downside is that it can get quite crowded during weekends.**  

**Place Name: Talegate Bookshop Cafe**  
**Rating: ★★★★★**  
**Review: A perfect spot for book and tea lovers like me. I often find myself lost among the amazing selection of novels. Their cream scones are delicious and pair beautifully with a pot of Earl Grey. It's a cosy spot to spend a rainy afternoon.**  

**Place Name: St. George's Park**  
**Rating: ★★★★☆**  
**Review: A pleasant local park perfect for morning walks. The flower beds are always well-maintained, and the walking paths are nice and wide. It's particularly lovely in spring. I wish there were more benches for resting spots as some areas can be quite spread out.**  

**Place Name: Whispering Pine Hotel (Edinburgh)**  
**Rating: ★★★★☆**  
**Review: Stayed here during a short trip to Edinburgh. A charming, old-fashioned hotel with a lot of character. The staff were courteous and the breakfast was hearty. The location made it easy to explore the city. My only critique is that the bathroom facilities could use an update. Overall, a comfortable stay.**  

**Place Name: Flower Delight Bakery**  
**Rating: ★★★★★**
