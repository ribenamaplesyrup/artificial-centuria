Thomas Bailey resides in a modest one-bedroom flat located on the second floor of a brick Victorian building in Dalston, London. He rents the space, which, while compact, is well-utilized and comfortable. The flat features a small living area that doubles as his workspace, with a simple desk cluttered with office supplies and papers for his role as an office administrator at the local council. The decor is minimalistic with neutral-colored walls, a well-worn couch adorned with a couple of cushions, and a small television perched in the corner where he enjoys watching football matches in the evenings. The kitchen is functional, equipped with essential appliances, but offers little in terms of style—just a small table where Thomas prepares his straightforward, home-cooked meals. The flat lacks significant decorative elements, reflecting his practical sensibilities and busy lifestyle. Notable features include a collection of football memorabilia displayed on a shelf and a small bookshelf filled with novels and reference materials from his A-level studies. The state of tidiness is generally decent; the flat is organized but shows signs of a lived-in home, with occasional dishes in the sink and papers scattered about, indicative of his hectic work life.
