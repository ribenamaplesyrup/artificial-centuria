Joyce Williams does not currently have any pets. Living in a cozy flat in Dalston, London, Joyce enjoys her peaceful retirement filled with reading and volunteering activities. Her lifestyle and regular commitments with the local historical society keep her busy, leaving little time for the daily care that pets require. Additionally, Joyce's residence has strict rules regarding pet ownership, which further discourages her from considering pets. Instead, she occasionally petsits for her neighbors, enjoying brief, playful interactions with their furry companions without the long-term responsibilities.
