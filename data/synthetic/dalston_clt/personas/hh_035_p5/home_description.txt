Maggie Turner lives in a cozy, two-bedroom flat in a vibrant neighborhood of Dalston, London, where she shares the space with her family. The flat is owned by her parents, who have created a warm and welcoming environment that reflects their lively yet practical lifestyle. The living area is a blend of playful chaos and comforting familiarity, with a well-loved, oversized sofa covered in colorful throws and cushions, and a coffee table that doubles as a craft station for Maggie’s drawing supplies. Brightly colored artwork, mostly created by Maggie, adorns the walls, showcasing her passion for illustration. The overall decor leans toward a casual, eclectic style with mismatched furniture pieces that have been collected over the years, giving it a lived-in feel. The flat, while not always tidy, has a certain charm; toys and art supplies often clutter the floor, interspersed with magazines and half-finished homework. The sibling dynamic is evident too, with a door leading to Maggie's room, where an ongoing battle for computer time with her older sister often results in the room's door being slightly ajar, revealing organized chaos: a bed strewn with blankets, and a desk overflowing with sketchbooks and art supplies. The space exudes a playful spirit that is quintessentially her age, filled with the echoes of laughter from family interactions and animated discussions over cartoons.
