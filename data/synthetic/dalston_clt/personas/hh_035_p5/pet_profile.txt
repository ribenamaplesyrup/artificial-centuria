Maggie Turner does not have any pets. Due to her young age and the housing situation at 2 Mason's Brook Mews, it's likely that the family doesn't have the flexibility or freedom to own pets. Additionally, living in a rental property may come with restrictions on pet ownership. Maggie's busy lifestyle as a student and her focus on schoolwork, drawing, and spending time with her family also limit the time and responsibility she would have to care for a pet.
