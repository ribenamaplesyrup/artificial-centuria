- Don't forget to call the clinic tomorrow to confirm that appointment for Mrs. Patel.
- Goal: Try a new recipe this weekend – maybe that chickpea curry everyone raves about?
- Just watched that doc on Netflix about healthcare in the UK. So eye-opening how stressed everyone is. Makes me appreciate my job more.
- Need to remember to pick up milk and bread on the way home. 
- Birthday gift for Sarah – think about getting her that cookbook she mentioned last week.
