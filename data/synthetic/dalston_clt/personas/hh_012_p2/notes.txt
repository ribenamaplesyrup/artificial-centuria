- Remember to check lab results for that patient tomorrow morning. Need to update them on the next steps.  
- Goal for this month: go back to the gym at least twice a week after night shifts.  
- Just finished a documentary about street art. Can’t believe how vibrant the community is! Must visit that new mural downtown.  
- Feeling a bit overwhelmed with night shifts and life balance. Need to carve out some time for myself, maybe a weekend art class?  
- Grocery list: milk, instant noodles, bananas, and some more of those protein bars. Don’t forget to pick up mom’s birthday gift!
