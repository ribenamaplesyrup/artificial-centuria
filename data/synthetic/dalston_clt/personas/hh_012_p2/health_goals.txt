- Diet: Aim for balanced meals focusing on lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of veggies to maintain energy for woodworking. Consider reducing red meat and processed foods to support heart health. Maybe try to have fish at least twice a week for those omega-3s.

- Exercise: Keep up with daily walks, incorporating 30 minutes of brisk walking in nearby parks. Some light stretching or yoga to stay flexible can help, especially for those knees and back after long hours at the workbench.

- Health Concerns: Regular check-ups for blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Be mindful of signs of arthritis, common at this age, due to repetitive work movements. Eye check-ups are important too, given the detailed work with antique furniture.

- Medications/Supplements: Look into general supplements like vitamin D and calcium for bone health. If recommended by the doctor, maybe glucosamine for joint health.

- Doctor Appointments: Book appointments for routine screenings like prostate checks and discuss any persistent pains from work. Mention any recent changes in eyesight or joint stiffness.

- Mental Health: Continue regular chess sessions and social outings. These are great for mental sharpness and social engagement, both crucial for well-being at this stage of life.
