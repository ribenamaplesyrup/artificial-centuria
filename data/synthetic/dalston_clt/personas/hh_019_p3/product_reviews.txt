**Platform: Amazon**  
**Rating: ★★★★☆**  
**Review:** The Kindle Paperwhite is a great device for an old-fashioned book lover like me who enjoys the convenience of carrying several novels at once. The screen is easy on the eyes, and the battery life is fantastic. While I still prefer the smell of a new book, having a library in my handbag has its perks, especially during my afternoon visits to the park. One minor drawback is the slightly slower speed when navigating through some menus.
