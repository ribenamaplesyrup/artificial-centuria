**Pet Profile for Olivia Bailey**

**Type of Pets:** None

**Reason for No Pets:** Olivia is currently a university student living in a rented flat where pets are not allowed due to landlord regulations. Additionally, her busy lifestyle and commitments to her studies make it challenging to provide the necessary time and attention that a pet would require. She often travels back late from campus events using the night bus, which would make it difficult to maintain a consistent routine for pet care. While she loves animals, her current living situation and academic obligations prevent her from owning a pet at this time.
