Norman Bailey lives in a modest, two-bedroom terraced house located at 14 Elderbloom Way Street in Dalston, London. He owns the property outright, having lived there for several decades after purchasing it as a young man. The house reflects a simple, functional style with its plain brick exterior and small front garden, which he tends to with care, though it offers little in the way of ornamental plants. Inside, the decor is fairly sparse and utilitarian, consisting of mismatched furniture pieces collected over the years, many of which have been well-loved from his days as a bricklayer. The living room, where he spends most of his afternoons watching daytime television, features a well-worn sofa and an old yet reliable armchair, accompanied by a small coffee table cluttered with magazines and television guides. The kitchen serves as his favorite retreat, where he enjoys drinking tea while listening to the radio, surrounded by an assortment of essential appliances that show signs of age but still function well. Overall, the space is tidy, albeit a touch cluttered, reflecting Norman's practical approach to life rather than a penchant for aesthetics, and it embodies a warmth that echoes his long-standing residency in the area.
