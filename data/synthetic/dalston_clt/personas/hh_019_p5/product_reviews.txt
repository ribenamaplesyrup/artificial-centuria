**Product:** BBC News App  
**Platform:** App Store  
**Rating:** ★★★★☆  
**Review:** "I downloaded the BBC News app to stay updated on current events. It's user-friendly, which is great for someone like me who isn't too tech-savvy. I wish it had a feature for more in-depth local stories, but overall, a solid app for catching up with the news. Works well on my tablet while I sit at the kitchen table."

**Product:** Philips Electric Kettle  
**Platform:** Amazon  
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** "I had high hopes for this kettle, especially after reading the rave reviews. It boils water quickly, but the lid is a bit tricky to open without splashing – not ideal if you’re in a rush for your tea. Still, it gets the job done, just be careful when filling it!"

**Product:** Netflix Subscription  
**Platform:** Official Website  
**Rating:** ★★★★☆  
**Review:** "I signed up for Netflix mostly to catch up on some old shows I loved, and it hasn't disappointed. There’s a vast selection, from classic films to newer series. The only reason I’m not giving it five stars is that navigating it can be a bit confusing for someone of my age. But once I get the hang of it, I enjoy binge-watching quite a few dramas on Thursday afternoons!"
