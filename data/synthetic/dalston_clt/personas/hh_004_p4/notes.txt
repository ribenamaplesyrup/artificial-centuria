- Remember to study for History exam this weekend—use flashcards for key dates!  
- Get groceries after school: milk, bread, and maybe some snacks for movie night.  
- OMG, that YouTube video about the latest trends in makeup was so cool! Might try that glitter eye look for the party.  
- Really need to focus more on my coursework. I keep getting distracted by social media—set timer for an hour of study before checking Insta.  
- Dentist Tuesday at 3pm, don’t forget to ask about retainers.
