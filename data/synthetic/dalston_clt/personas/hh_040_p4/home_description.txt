Leyla Yilmaz lives in a cozy two-bedroom flat in a charming older building at 7 Mason's Brook Mews, nestled in the vibrant neighborhood of Dalston, London. The flat is owned by her parents, who space it out with her older brother. Leyla's room is a delightful den brimming with creativity; walls painted in a soft pastel pink are adorned with her vibrant drawings and various artwork she’s created with her sketchbook. The decor leans towards a whimsical style, with fairy lights draped across her bed and stacks of colorful plush toys scattered around her floor. A small desk, cluttered with art supplies, stands in one corner, while a bookshelf filled with children's books and cartoon DVDs occupies another. Although the space can sometimes be a bit messy with crayons and unfinished projects strewn about, it reflects her imaginative spirit and playful nature. After school, she often retreats here to watch cartoons or immerse herself in her creative pursuits, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere filled with the joy of childhood.
