**The Green Kitchen**  
*Restaurant*  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
"The Green Kitchen has become my go-to for plant-based meals! Everything on the menu is so fresh and vibrant. I tried their quinoa salad and the beetroot burger, both bursting with flavor. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere is really chill — perfect for catching up with friends or even just a solo lunch after a long walk. Would highly recommend!"

**Dalston Auto Care**  
*Mechanic*  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
"Had a great experience with Dalston Auto Care. My car had been making this weird noise for weeks, and I finally decided to get it checked out. They were quick to diagnose the problem and gave me a fair price for the repairs. The team was friendly and didn’t make me feel intimidated, which is a huge plus for someone not too savvy with cars. Happy to recommend!"

**Pasta & Co.**  
*Italian Restaurant*  
⭐️⭐️⭐️  
"I wanted to love Pasta & Co. as it’s so cute and cozy. I mean, who doesn’t love a good spaghetti dish? I ordered the classic spaghetti carbonara, but it was a bit too salty for my taste. The service was attentive, and the ambiance was lovely — perfect for a date night! I might give it another try with a different dish next time."

**Brew & Co. Cafe**  
*Coffee Shop*  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
"Brew & Co. is my happy place! Their cappucino is just the right balance of coffee and foam — my favourite way to start a day off after a long walk. The pastries are also to die for, especially the almond croissant! The vibe is super cozy, with lots of books if you're looking to relax with a good read. Love supporting local spots like this."

**The Flower Boutique**  
*Florist*  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
"Ordered a bouquet for my friend's birthday from The Flower Boutique, and I was so impressed! The selection is beautiful and unique. They even have a lovely selection of sustainable options. My friend was thrilled, and the flowers lasted a surprisingly long time! A bit on the pricier side, but for the quality, I think it’s worth it."
