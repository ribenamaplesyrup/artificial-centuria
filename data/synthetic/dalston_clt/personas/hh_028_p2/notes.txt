1. Draft an email to Maggie about the Johnson case—ensure all points on tenant rights are clear; no stone unturned.

2. Pin: Community cycling event planning meeting next Thursday at 6 PM, St. Mary's Hall.

3. Finally finished that article on urban green spaces. Really compelling arguments on their impact on mental health—worth discussing at the next town hall.

4. Must remember to book in for the kids’ dentist appointments before Sunday and pick up the winter school uniforms.

5. Gift idea for Leah’s birthday: check out that new bookstore on Kingsland High Street. She's always wanted first editions.
