**Health/Wellness Goals for Miranda Armstrong**

**Diet Goals:**
- Aim for more whole foods: try to add 1-2 servings of fruits and veggies per day. Think about snacking on apples or baby carrots instead of chips.
- Cut back on processed foods: focus on cooking quick meals with fresh ingredients on days off.
- Stay hydrated: carry a water bottle during night shifts to sneak in more water. Try to drink at least 6-8 glasses a day.
- Consider reducing sugar intake, especially sodas and snacks during late-night shifts—maybe limit to 1 sweet treat per week.

**Exercise Intentions:**
- Start with short, 15-20 minute walks a few times a week after work, especially on days off. It’s a good way to unwind.
- Explore bodyweight exercises at home, like squats, lunges, or even some yoga stretches—something to do before work to get energized.
- Consider finding a community class to try once a week—like Zumba or a local walking group—something fun to look forward to.

**Health Concerns:**
- Be mindful of fatigue from night shifts; prioritize sleep as much as possible.
- Watch for signs of joint or muscle pain given the physical nature of cleaning work; regular stretching could help.
- Consider monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels, especially if there’s family history—might be good to ask the doctor about this at the next appointment.

**Medications or Supplements:**
- Multivitamins could be a good option to cover any nutritional gaps, especially with a varied diet.
- Calcium and Vitamin D supplements might help with bone health, particularly since women can be more prone to osteoporosis as they age.
- If feeling stressed or anxious, consider talking to the doctor about herbal supplements like chamomile or valerian root.

**Doctor Appointment Notes:**
- Schedule an annual check-up to monitor overall health—important to stay on top of any potential issues.
- Discuss any fatigue or sleep issues given nighttime work; might be worth exploring sleep hygiene tips or adjusting schedules when possible.
- Bring up vaccination updates, especially flu shots annually—important for maintaining good health, especially during winter. 

Keep it simple, focus on what feels good, and make small adjustments! You’ve got this, Miranda!
