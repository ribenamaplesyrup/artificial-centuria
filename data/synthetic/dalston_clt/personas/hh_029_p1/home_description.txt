Desmond Adeyemi lives in a modest flat situated on the top floor of Ironmonger Pass Estate in Dalston, London, which he rents. The living space is compact but functional, featuring a small kitchenette that opens into a cozy living area where he spends his afternoons engrossed in reruns of old TV shows. The flat's decor is minimalistic and somewhat dated, consisting of mismatched furniture acquired over the years, including a well-worn armchair and a small dining table that doubles as his workspace for sorting through grocery flyers each week. The walls are adorned with a few framed photographs of family and friends, capturing memories of days gone by. Notable features include a small bookshelf filled with an assortment of novels and magazines, which reflects his love for reading, although they often remain untouched since his retirement. The state of tidiness in Desmond's flat is generally good, with a routine cleaning schedule that he maintains, though the occasional accumulation of dust and clutter is evident, as he sometimes prioritizes his TV time over tidying up. Each Thursday, he makes his way to the local market, an outing that adds a touch of routine and community engagement to his otherwise quiet life.
