Mustafa Arslan resides in Flat 5 of Ironmonger Pass Estate, a modest, council-owned flat in a bustling part of Dalston, London. At 68, he enjoys a comfortable retirement after years of working as a bus driver, and he rents his flat, which is well-situated near local parks and shops. The living space is cozy but unpretentious, characterized by essential furnishings rather than elaborate decor—simple, sturdy pieces that reflect a life well-lived. The walls are painted in warm, neutral tones, adorned sporadically with framed photographs of his family and cherished memories of his driving days. His balcony is a notable feature, where he cultivates a small vegetable garden, proudly growing tomatoes and herbs, which he often shares with neighbors. The flat is tidy, though not overly so; there are traces of everyday life, like chess pieces left out from his afternoon games at the park and the occasional newspaper lying on the coffee table. Throughout the space, a relaxed ambiance is palpable, indicative of Mustafa’s easygoing personality and connection to his community.
