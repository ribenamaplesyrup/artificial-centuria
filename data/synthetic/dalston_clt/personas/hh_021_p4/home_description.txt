Felix Laurent resides in a modest, two-bedroom Victorian terraced house in Dalston, London, which he owns outright after years of diligent saving and investment during his public sector career. The front room, filled with sunlight, features a well-worn leather armchair positioned beside a small wooden coffee table stacked with newspapers and current affairs magazines that he pores over each morning. The decor is understated, with a preference for muted colors and functional furnishings, reflecting a practicality that has characterized much of his life; family photos and local artwork add a personal touch to the otherwise simple walls. Felix's kitchen is small but inviting, outfitted with vintage appliances and a well-used dining table that often serves as the venue for community discussions or family gatherings. A well-kept garden, filled with herbs and flowering plants, provides a tranquil escape and a reminder of his nurturing spirit. His home remains tidy, though lived-in, marked by a regular maintenance routine that keeps clutter at bay while allowing the warmth of a lived-in space to shine through. Overall, Felix's home embodies a blend of comfort and simplicity, perfectly aligned with his values and lifestyle.
