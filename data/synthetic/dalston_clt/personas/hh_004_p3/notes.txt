- Need to finalize my project on renewable energy use in urban areas by next week. Focus on case studies!  
 
- Reminder: Thursdays are for volunteering at the garden. Bring my gloves this time!  

- Just finished that documentary on climate change. Can’t believe how much plastic ends up in the ocean. Makes me want to do more!  

- Feeling a bit overwhelmed with coursework lately. Need to take breaks and remember why I started studying this in the first place.  

- Pick up milk and bread after class. Also, check if the new game release is live tomorrow.
