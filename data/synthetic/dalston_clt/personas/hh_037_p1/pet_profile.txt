**Pet Profile for Joseph Carpenter**

**Pets: None**

**Explanation:**
Joseph leads a busy lifestyle as a plumber, working long hours on residential repairs, which leaves him with little time to dedicate to a pet. Additionally, his living situation in a rented property may come with restrictions on pet ownership, making it impractical for him to have animals. Joseph prefers to spend his free time socializing with friends on Wednesday evenings rather than managing the responsibilities that come with pet care.
