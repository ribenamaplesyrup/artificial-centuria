**The Spicy Curry House**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

As a long-time curry lover, I have to say The Spicy Curry House is one of my favorites in Dalston. Their lamb vindaloo packs a punch, and I've never had a dish that wasn't packed with flavor. The staff are friendly, and it's nice to catch up with mates over a few pints here after a long week. Just do yourself a favor and save room for their mango lassi; it’s perfect for cooling down after the spice!

Great selection of organic products and local produce! I pop in here regularly for healthy snacks and some fresh fruits and veggies. It's perfect for someone like me who's always rushing from one project to another. The staff are incredibly helpful too – they'll point you to what's in season and on sale. Highly recommend checking this place out!

**The Green Man Pub**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

A solid local pub! I’ve been coming here on Wednesday evenings for pints with my college mates for years. They've got a great selection of local ales and a cozy atmosphere. The bar staff are always friendly, and it's the perfect spot to unwind after a long day down the pipes. Can't comment on the food all that much, but the occasional sausage roll isn't bad!

**Kebab Delight**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Best kebab I've had in a long time! Always cooked to perfection and stuffed with fresh veggies. I usually grab one on my way home after a long day on the job; it's quick, filling, and never disappoints. They do get quite busy late at night, but that's just the price of great food, isn't it?

**The Crafty Baker**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Joseph Carpenter  
Absolutely love this little bakery! The fresh bread and pastries remind me of my trips to France. I often swing by on Saturdays for a loaf and to treat myself to a sweet pastry. The almond croissants are my go-to; fluffy and packed with just the right amount of almond paste. If you're in the area, don’t miss out on this gem!

**Colins' Hardware Store**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Joseph Carpenter  
A plumber’s paradise! If you're into DIY or need anything for home repairs, this place is a must-visit. They have a great selection of tools and materials, and the owner always knows his stuff. I've found everything I needed for my half-finished projects. My only gripe is that sometimes they’re a bit understaffed, but the prices are fair, so I can't complain too much.

**Oasis Park**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Joseph Carpenter  
What a fantastic spot to take a breather! I like to grab lunch and head over here to sit and have a little peace before heading back to the chaos of the city. It's well-kept, with lots of green spaces and benches; perfect for a quick break or a catch-up with old friends. The kids play area is always busy, but it adds to the lively atmosphere.

**Lakeside Retreat (Day Trip)**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Joseph Carpenter  
Had a lovely day out at Lakeside Retreat last weekend. A great spot to escape the hustle and bustle of London! The scenery is stunning, and I especially enjoyed the walking trails. The café there is a bit pricey, but the coffee was decent and the view made it worth it. Perfect for some fresh air and a bit of exercise – I might just return with a picnic next time!
