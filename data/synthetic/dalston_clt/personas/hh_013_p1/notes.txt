- Start draft for the community center's fall events newsletter. Need to include info about the multicultural potluck next month.
- Buy some saffron and paneer for the weekend cooking experiment—maybe try that recipe from the Syrian cookbook.
- Just finished "The Vanishing Half"—really powerful story about identity and belonging. Must recommend to the book club.
- Feeling grateful for how the community is coming together lately. Volunteering reminds me how much we all rely on each other.
- Don't forget to pick up the dry cleaning on Thursday.
