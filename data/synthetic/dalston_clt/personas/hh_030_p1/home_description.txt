Paul Watkins resides in a modest two-bedroom flat located on the third floor of Ironmonger Pass Estate in Dalston, London. As a renter, he shares the space with a longtime friend, which helps him manage the cost of living in the city. The flat has a practical layout, featuring a small but functional kitchen that opens into a cozy living area, where he often unwinds after work. The decor is minimal and utilitarian; the walls are painted a neutral beige, and most furnishings consist of second-hand items collected over the years. A well-used leather sofa dominates the living room, with the occasional sports poster lazily pinned to the walls. The kitchen is equipped with basic appliances, but lacks any personal touches or embellishments. Notable features include a small dining table, cluttered with old takeaway menus and beer coasters, and a mass of tools and equipment strewn across a corner, a testament to his trade as an electrician. Despite the lived-in appearance, Paul maintains a level of tidiness, ensuring the flat is neat enough for guests but reflects the relaxed, slightly chaotic lifestyle of a busy tradesman.
