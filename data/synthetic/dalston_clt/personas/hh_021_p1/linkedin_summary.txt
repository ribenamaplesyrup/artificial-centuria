As a seasoned history teacher with over 15 years of experience in the classroom, I am passionately committed to bringing the stories of the past to life for my students. With a Master's degree in Education, I strive to create an engaging and inclusive environment where history becomes a vibrant tapestry rather than just dates and facts. My approach to teaching is centered around fostering curiosity and critical thinking, encouraging students to connect historical events with contemporary issues, and inspiring them to see the relevance of history in their own lives.

Outside the classroom, you'll often find me immersed in the tranquility of my garden. Tending to my plants offers a refreshing balance and fuels my creativity and patience, qualities I bring into my professional life. As a resident of Dalston, I'm deeply connected to my community and enjoy attending local events and markets, which further enriches my understanding of history and culture. I believe in the power of storytelling, whether it’s through the narrative of a garden or the chronicles of the past, to connect people and ideas.

Communication, for me, is about authenticity and clarity. I value open dialogue and believe in exchanging ideas with honesty and respect. Whether I’m in front of a classroom or engaged in a community event, my goal is to connect with my audience and inspire meaningful conversations. As someone who considers himself a centrist, I appreciate diverse perspectives and enjoy exploring different viewpoints, both in my professional life and personal interests.
