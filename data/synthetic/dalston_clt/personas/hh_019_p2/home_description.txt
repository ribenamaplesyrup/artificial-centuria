Martha Bailey lives in a cozy two-bedroom flat on the first floor of a charming period building at 14 Elderbloom Way in Dalston, London, which she rents with a small monthly income from her self-employed seamstress work. The space reflects her creative personality, with sewing supplies and fabric swatches scattered throughout, yet it maintains a warm and inviting atmosphere. The living area features a mix of eclectic thrifted furniture and practical storage solutions that showcase her handiwork, including a vintage sewing machine positioned next to a large window that floods the room with natural light. While the decor leans towards a bohemian style, with handmade quilts and vibrant fabrics adorning the walls, the overall aesthetic is a bit cluttered, reflecting her busy schedule and ongoing projects. Notable items include a large corkboard filled with pinned reminders and sketches, and a collection of vintage scissors and sewing notions displayed on a shelf. Despite the slight disorder, Martha keeps her home tidy, dedicating weekends to organization and cleaning, ensuring her work area is functional for her clients. On Thursdays, she enjoys the local market, often returning with fresh flowers to brighten her space.
