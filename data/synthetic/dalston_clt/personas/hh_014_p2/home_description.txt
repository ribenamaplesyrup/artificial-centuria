Elena Ivanova resides in a modest one-bedroom flat on the second floor of a red brick building in the lively neighborhood of Dalston, London. Renting the apartment, she appreciates the affordability and proximity to her café job, enjoying the vibrant community spirit that surrounds her. The flat is cozy and functional, decorated in a bohemian style that reflects her creative side. The living space is filled with colorful throws, vintage posters from local art fairs, and handmade ceramics. A small but impressive collection of coffee brewing equipment takes pride of place on her kitchen counter, a testament to her passion for experimenting with different coffee recipes. Despite her busy schedule, Elena maintains her home to a reasonable degree of tidiness, though a few art magazines or coffee cups are often left scattered in her living room—a charming sign of her bustling daily life.
