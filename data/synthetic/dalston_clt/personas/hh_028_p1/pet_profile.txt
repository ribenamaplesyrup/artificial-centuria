Efe Adebayo does not have any pets. His lifestyle and current living situation make it challenging to care for animals. Working night shifts at a distribution center means he has a non-traditional schedule that could conflict with the needs of many pets, requiring regular feeding and attention. Additionally, living in a flat may come with restrictions on pet ownership, and since he sleeps during the day, it wouldn't be fair to an animal that requires companionship and activity during those hours. All these factors contribute to his decision to remain pet-free, ensuring he can focus on his job and personal fitness without the added responsibility of caring for a pet.
