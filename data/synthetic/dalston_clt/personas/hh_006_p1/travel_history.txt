Michael Oseni, a secondary school teacher from Dalston, London, has had a modest travel history over the past few years, keeping in mind his family and professional commitments. With a tendency towards budget-friendly and family-oriented travel, he has mostly embarked on trips during school holidays, maximizing both time and affordability.

In the summer of 2021, Michael and his family took a road trip to Cornwall, exploring the stunning coastal landscapes and indulging in local Cornish cuisine. This trip was booked through a popular travel app that offered discounts for family stays at a local bed and breakfast, emphasizing budget-conscious choices.

In the spring of 2022, Michael participated in a professional development workshop in Edinburgh. While primarily a business trip, he managed to extend his stay over the weekend to explore the city's rich history and vibrant culture. His school arranged the travel, but he took the opportunity to book a guided walking tour of the Royal Mile through an online deal.

During the winter break in 2022, the family visited Paris, fulfilling a dream trip for both him and his children—visiting museums and historical sites while enjoying the city's renowned gastronomy. This trip was planned as a package deal found through a travel agent, which offered a combination of affordability and convenience.

As of summer 2023, Michael and his family opted for a staycation due to rising travel costs and some home renovations. They explored nearby national parks and enjoyed several day trips, embracing local adventures and the simplicity of stay-local culture.

Looking ahead, Michael dreams of visiting Japan, driven by its unique mix of tradition and modernity. His bucket list also includes a family safari in Kenya and an educational trip to Egypt's pyramids—destinations he hopes to experience once his children are a little older and finances allow for it.
