As a passionate History Teacher at a local secondary school in Dalston, London, I strive to ignite curiosity and critical thinking about the past in my students. With a Master’s degree in History, I bring a deep understanding of historical narratives and their significance to contemporary society. My focus is not just on imparting knowledge, but on fostering a love for learning and encouraging students to draw connections between historical events and current issues.

Outside the classroom, I find joy in the simple moments, like stopping by the market for fresh vegetables on my way home. These daily rituals ground me and provide balance amid the busy school days filled with grading and lesson planning. I am particularly interested in exploring how history shapes our present, with a strong belief in using education as a tool for social change. I welcome conversations with fellow educators and anyone interested in culturally responsive teaching and the role of history in a progressive future.
