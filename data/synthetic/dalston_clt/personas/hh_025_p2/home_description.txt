Lisa Turner resides in a modest flat within the Osier Grove Estate in Dalston, London, where she rents her unit. The flat is compact yet cozy, consisting of two bedrooms, a small kitchen, and a living area that opens onto a petite balcony. Bright and airy, the flat is thoughtfully decorated with a blend of vintage finds and budget-friendly contemporary pieces, reflecting Lisa’s eclectic yet practical style. The living space is punctuated by lush houseplants that add a touch of greenery, and family photos and artwork from local artists hang on the walls. Thanks to her keen interest in cooking, the kitchen is well-stocked with various spices and utensils, allowing her to experiment with new recipes. The balcony is a small oasis where Lisa indulges in her love of gardening, adorned with pots of herbs and seasonal flowers. Despite her busy schedule, she maintains the flat in a clean and organized state, with each item having its place, making her home a welcoming and comfortable retreat.
