1. Need to finish grading history papers tonight—maybe find a different exercise for the Ottoman Empire lesson next week.

2. Buy seeds for the spring garden: tomatoes, basil, and maybe try some peppers this year?

3. That article on the decline of literacy rates in adolescents was alarming—must find ways to incorporate more engaging reading materials in class.

4. Remember to set up the volunteer meeting with the community center for the weekend.

5. Dentist appointment on Thursday at 2pm—don’t forget this time!
