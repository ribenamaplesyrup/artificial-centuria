**Bio:**
Compassionate nurse by day, book-loving adventurer by night. I enjoy getting lost in a good story, whether it's through fiction or a long jog around Dalston's parks. Passionate about making a difference, you can often find me volunteering at local community centers. Looking for someone to share new experiences and endless laughter with. Bonus points if you’re into yoga or book swaps!
