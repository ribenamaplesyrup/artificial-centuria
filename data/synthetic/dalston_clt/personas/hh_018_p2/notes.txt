- Need to remind the team about the green tech proposal deadline next Thursday. Push for sustainable materials in our new project.
- Remember to grab oat milk and coffee on the way home. Also, schedule bike repair for this weekend.
- Just watched a documentary on urban cycling in Copenhagen. Really inspiring – can we adopt some of these ideas in London?
- Felt good biking to work today despite the drizzle; keeps me grounded and connected to the city.
- Call Mum on Sunday, been a while since we talked. Also, look into the TV series Dave mentioned at lunch, seemed interesting.
