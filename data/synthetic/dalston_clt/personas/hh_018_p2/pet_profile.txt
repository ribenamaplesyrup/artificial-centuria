Mary Fry does not have any pets. Due to her part-time work schedule and the demands of maintaining her home, she has chosen not to adopt any animals. Additionally, living in a rental property may present restrictions on pet ownership. Mary has mentioned that she enjoys the companionship of animals but finds that her lifestyle—focused on her job, knitting, and staying connected with family and friends—does not leave her with the time needed for proper pet care. Allergies to pet dander also contribute to her decision to remain pet-free, as they would complicate her enjoyment of her hobbies and social interactions.
