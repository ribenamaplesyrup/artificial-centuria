- Need to finish wiring the new kitchen on Elm Street tomorrow. Just double-check the circuit specs again tonight.  
- Reminder to buy extra light bulbs for the van this week. Don't want to run out on-site again.  
- Finally watched that show Sarah recommended. It was alright, but not as gripping as I expected.   
- Thinking about how I haven't had a proper holiday in ages—maybe I should book something soon.   
- Pick up milk and bread on the way home. Dentist Tuesday at 3pm—don't forget!
