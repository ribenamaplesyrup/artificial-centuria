1. Need to order that new set of spark plugs for the shop before the weekend - don’t forget this time!

2. Grocery list: milk, eggs, bread, that fancy cheese Leyla likes, and some snacks for the game on Saturday.

3. Saw a video about rebuilding classic engines last night - got me thinking about starting a side project on that old Triumph bike in the garage.

4. Don’t forget: dentist appointment on Thursday at 11 am. Maybe set a reminder for Wednesday night so I don’t sleep in.

5. Had a fun match with the guys today. Scored twice and realized how much I miss playing regularly. Gonna make an effort to join those weekly games more often.
