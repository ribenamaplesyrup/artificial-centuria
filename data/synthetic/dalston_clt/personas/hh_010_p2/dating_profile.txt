**Emre Kaya, 31**

**Location:** Dalston, London  
**Occupation:** Mechanic  

**Bio:**  
Hey, I'm Emre. I spend my days making engines purr and my weekends hanging out at car meet-ups. If you love the smell of gasoline or can appreciate a well-tuned engine, we’ll probably get along great. When I'm not under the hood, you'll find me cheering on my favorite football team or playing five-a-side with mates.

**What I'm looking for:**  
Someone down-to-earth who appreciates the simple things in life. Bonus points if you can name at least three Premier League teams or aren't afraid to try and change a tire. Good vibes and a shared laugh go a long way.

**Deal-Breakers:**  
Negativity, dishonesty, and an aversion to getting a little oil on your hands.

**Photos I'd Use:**  
1. A picture of me at the garage, holding a wrench with a cheeky grin.
2. An action shot of me playing a five-a-side football game.
3. At a car meet-up, standing next to a vintage car with a sunset in the background.
4. A relaxed photo of me and my mates at the pub, celebrating a football win.
5. Me on my motorcycle, looking out over the London skyline.

**Prompts/Answers:**

- **Let's make sure we:** Go for a twisty motorcycle ride before grabbing some street food.
- **Two truths and a lie:** 
   1. I’ve rebuilt a car engine with just my own tools.
   2. I once met Beckham at a match.
   3. I'm fluent in four languages.
- **The key to my heart is:** Laughing so hard we can't breathe.

Let's see where the road takes us! 🚗💨
