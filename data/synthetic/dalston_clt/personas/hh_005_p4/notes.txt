1. Check out that thrift store on Kingsland Road—might find some cool vintage pieces for my new outfit idea.

2. Reminder: Art project due on Friday! Need to finish the sketch tonight after studying for math.

3. Just watched the latest episode of "Project Runway"—the way they used recycled materials was genius. Totally inspiring!

4. Don't forget to pick up some new sketching pencils and a notebook before the weekend.

5. Need to call mum to confirm plans for Saturday afternoon—maybe bake her favorite cookies as a surprise.
