**Chai Time Cafe - ★★★★★**  
This place is my favorite! Their chai latte is perfect, especially now that the weather is getting cooler. The atmosphere is cozy, with the cutest decor—ideal for catching up with friends after school. I really appreciate how the baristas are always up for a chat, which makes every visit extra special!

**Threads Boutique - ★★★★☆**  
This boutique has the best selection of unique clothes in Dalston. I love popping in to check out the latest arrivals. The staff is super friendly and great at helping piece together outfits. The only downside is that some items are a bit pricey, so I mostly go when they have sales.

**Hackett Green Park - ★★★★★**  
Living so close to this park is awesome! It’s a lovely spot for morning jogs or sketching sessions on weekends. The greenery is refreshing and the playground is perfect for families. It's clean and well-maintained, which is a huge plus in my book.

**Pizza Palace - ★★★★☆**  
Great pizza place near my school. The margherita is my go-to; always fresh and tasty. Sometimes, it gets busy after school, so the wait is longer. But it’s worth it for a slice that’s consistently good!

**Fashion Finds Thrift Store - ★★★★★**  
This thrift store is a gem! They've got incredible vintage pieces at really affordable prices. I love going here to find unique items that nobody else will have. The staff are really laid-back and they have good music playing, makes the shopping experience so fun.

**Bun & Brew Café - ★★★☆☆**  
Stopped by with a friend last weekend. The burgers were decent, but the fries were a bit too salty for my taste. Service was good, and the atmosphere is nice, but overall it's just an okay spot compared to other local joints.

**Skyline Ice Skating Rink - ★★★★★**  
Visited here last winter with my friends, and it was such a blast! The rink is well-kept and though I spent more time on my bum than skating, we had so much fun. Plus, the hot chocolate from the concession stand is a must-try!

**Vintage Vault - ★★★★☆**  
A recent find I absolutely adore. This place has an eclectic mix of vintage furniture and quirky home decor. Even though I can't buy much yet, it's an inspiring spot for design ideas. A bit off the beaten path but totally worth the visit.
