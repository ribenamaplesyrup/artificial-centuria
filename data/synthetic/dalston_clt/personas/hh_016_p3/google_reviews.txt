Absolutely love this place! The burgers are massive and so tasty, plus they have a student discount which is perfect for my tight budget. The staff are always super friendly and there’s a good vibe. Ideal spot for a post-class meal with friends. Highly recommend the BBQ Bacon Burger!

**Dalston Books**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Great little local bookstore! I always find something interesting, whether it’s textbooks or some sci-fi novels to unwind after a long week of studying. It’s cozy and the staff are really knowledgeable about their stock. Just wish they had more seating for reading!

**Pop’s Pizzeria**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Best pizza in Dalston, hands down! The Margherita is a classic, and their crust is to die for. I've been ordering takeout while gaming at night, and it's perfect fuel for those late sessions. Bonus points for having quick delivery and friendly drivers!

**Dalston Junction Coffee**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
This coffee shop is a great place to study. The WiFi is fast, and they have a range of comfy seating. Their lattes are really good, and I appreciate that they support local suppliers. Sometimes it gets noisy when it’s busy, but overall, a solid spot to hit the books.

**Kensal Rise Market**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
I love this market! It has a great selection of fresh produce and unique food stalls. I often pop by on weekends to grab some snacks or fresh veggies for the week. Also, it's a fun place to explore and find cool local products. Definitely a gem in the area!

**The Crown Pub**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Nice pub for a casual night out with friends. They have a decent range of beers and the atmosphere is chilled, perfect for unwinding after a busy week. The quiz night on Thursdays is a blast, and it’s always fun to challenge my mates over some drinks!

**Dalston Primary Care Centre**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
I've had to visit the clinic a couple of times, and the staff here are always professional and caring. Short wait times and clean facilities. It’s comforting to have a good healthcare option close by, especially as a student who sometimes neglects my health!

**Hackney Marshes**  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Nice green space for a run or a walk when I need a break from studying. It’s spacious and has a lovely view, especially during sunset. I sometimes come here to clear my mind or play some casual soccer with friends. Nothing beats fresh air after hours in the books!
