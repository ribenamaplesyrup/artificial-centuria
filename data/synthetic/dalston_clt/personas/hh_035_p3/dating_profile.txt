**Bio Text:**  
"Just a 19-year-old political science student navigating the highs and lows of university life. If I’m not studying, you’ll find me jamming on my guitar or grabbing takeaways with friends on Fridays. Love deep convos over a good meal. Looking to meet someone who’s passionate about their interests and down for spontaneous adventures—bonus points if you can handle a little tunesmithing!"
