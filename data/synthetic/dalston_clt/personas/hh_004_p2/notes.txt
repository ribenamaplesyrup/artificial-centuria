- Need to finalize the lesson plan for next week’s math unit. Incorporate more hands-on activities to keep them engaged!

- Remind myself to pack extra snacks for the kids this week—think I noticed a few of them looking for more last Friday.

- Just finished that documentary Sarah recommended about the history of London—so fascinating! Need to see if there are more episodes.

- Feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything this month. Maybe it's time to take a walk in the park to clear my head.

- Grocery list: milk, bread, apples, and need to find a birthday gift for Lucy—maybe a new storybook?
