1. Must remember to ask Nate if he’s still got that weekend shift at the shop open—extra cash would be nice for the vintage fair on Saturday.

2. Need to find that article about upcycling fashion that Violet mentioned...maybe it’s got some good ideas for the old t-shirts in my closet.

3. Pick up soy milk, marmite, and maybe some of those fancy noodles Mark keeps talking about.

4. Note to self: Look into that DJ job opening at the club—could be a cool step up and right up my alley music-wise!

5. Caught myself smiling at the idea of working in a more creative space someday...someday soon, hopefully.
