**Business Name:** The Spicy Curry House  
**Type:** Indian Restaurant  
**Rating:** ★★★★☆  
**Review:** Honestly, The Spicy Curry House is a gem. I usually grab a takeaway after a long shift, and their Chicken Tikka Masala is on point. The naan is fluffy, which is key for scooping up all that sauce. It can get a bit spicy, so be warned if you’re not used to it. Service is pretty quick, usually have my order in under 20 minutes. Definitely a solid option for satisfying those late-night cravings!

**Business Name:** Tesco Express  
**Type:** Supermarket  
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** A decent spot for those quick lunches when you’re on the go. I've become a regular here, pretty much living off their meal deal. You can’t beat a sandwich, crisps, and a drink for under £4. Sometimes the sandwich selection is a bit hit or miss, but at least it’s convenient. And hey, it beats eating another bland burger on my delivery route!

**Business Name:** Jim's Haircuts  
**Type:** Hair Salon  
**Rating:** ★★★★☆  
**Review:** Finally found a reliable place for a quick trim! Jim knows what he’s doing and doesn’t waste time, which is exactly what I need between deliveries. The atmosphere is casual, and the prices are reasonable. I walked in with a rat's nest and walked out looking like a new man. Will definitely be back next month before the family see me again!

**Business Name:** RoadRunner Mechanics  
**Type:** Auto Repair   
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** Gave these guys a shot when my van started acting up. They diagnosed the issue quickly, which I appreciated as I can't afford to be off the road. Prices were fair, but they did take a bit longer than expected. Overall, a decent experience—better than my last mechanic for sure. Just make sure you drop off your ride in the morning if you need it back the same day!

**Business Name:** The Coffee House  
**Type:** Café  
**Rating:** ★★★☆☆  
**Review:** Stopped by for a quick coffee before my shift, and it’s alright. The flat whites are solid, but I wouldn’t call it the best in Dalston. Had a slice of cake, too, which was nice for a sweet treat. The vibe is chill, but the seating is limited. It’s a nice pit stop but not my go-to spot if I need to get some work done on the laptop.

**Business Name:** Taco Fiesta  
**Type:** Mexican Restaurant  
**Rating:** ★★★★★  
**Review:** Taco Fiesta is straight fire! The tacos are ridiculously good, especially the pulled pork ones. Fast service too, perfect for a guy like me always on the move. I usually make a stop after my shifts, and it never disappoints. Nothing beats a good taco trio to close out the night. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a tasty bite!
