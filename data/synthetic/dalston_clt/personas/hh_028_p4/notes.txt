- Need to finish that leaky pipe job at the Evans’ place before the weekend. Hopefully, it’s not too messy.  
- Reminder: Call Mom on Saturday and see if she needs anything from the market.  
- Saw that crazy goal in the City vs. Liverpool match last night. Gotta rewatch it later!  
- Really need to start saving for a holiday—maybe somewhere warm for a change.  
- Don’t forget to grab milk and bread on the way home. Also need to pick up a birthday gift for Uncle Mehmet.
